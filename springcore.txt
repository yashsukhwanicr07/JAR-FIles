5 steps to ceate a spring project
1. create a bean class
2. create a xml file
3. create a client class
4. add jar files
5. run 


class employee
{
String empID;
String empName;
String empAge;
char empGender;
}

Employee emp=new Employee();		// traditional way of creating objects in java
emp.id=20;
emp.empName="yash";
emp.empAge=22;
emp.empGender='M';

Spring core is based on inversion of controls (IOC)
You dont create objects.
Objects shall be configured in an xml file by the developer.
Spring container is responsible for creating the java objects by parsing an xml file.
// Advantage is xml file is not the part of source code so we can anytime manupulate the xml file and the objects will be created.

Creating sample code for spring named as SpringCoreDemo......

1.	create a new java project in sts....
2.	create a class with name SpringCoreDemo
3. 	create a class with name client
4. 	build path, add jar files.....

1st bean container is xmlbeanfactory
In main class
create an object of Resource by using ClassPathResource("xml file name")
create an object of spring container by using 
BeanFactory factory=new XmlBeanFactory(resource object)

2nd bean container is ApplicationContext
ApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("xml file name")
context.getbean(name);
